I was eager for a series that evoked the hothouse drama of female friendship. I found it not in Bushwick — but behind bars

Though *Orange Is the New Black* only went live a month ago, many of us have already binged on the entire season at least once (if it were on regular TV, we’d only be halfway through the season now), devouring the series with the ravenous hunger of a viewer looking to fill a void. Or at least alleviate the heartache of falling out of love with another show.

I came to *Orange* reeling from exasperation with *Girls*, a dark comedy I was enamored of until it devolved into a hot mess. I never wanted to like Girls. I had no interest in reliving the pain of being in my twenties, or being reintroduced to the entitled, irritating aimless sorts I’d first encountered when I moved to New York. But I was won over by the raw portrait of the friendship between Marnie and Hannah, by their neediness and miscommunications and betrayals and fights and fumbling attempts at making up. They were so excruciating to watch, and all too real. I really admired, and still admire, Lena Dunham for being able to simultaneously experience this life and have the remarkable insight to evoke it so faithfully and lay herself bare (often literally), and with such humor. And though the girls didn’t always pass the [Bechdel test](http://www.google.com) — they kvetched and agonized over boys and bad sex— the way they would wrestle with romantic intimacy was brutal and more honest than any depiction I’d ever seen on TV. Besides, they’re in their twenties, so of course they were going to be immersed in mishegoss. This forty-something-year-old lesbian is going to cut them some slack.
