An evening in Athens

Where were you when the sky was falling in February 2013? You know, when a meteor exploded over Siberia and injured more than a thousand Russians?

I remember where I was: sipping a Campari soda at Booze Cooperativa, a bar in central Athens, where an all-ages crowd plays chess on attractively weathered wooden tables.

I had unplugged from media consumption for a few days, so when the TV in the bar showed a montage of fireballs in the sky, I couldn't be sure if I was watching the local evening news or a Michael Bay production.

The volume was off, and the scenes of shattering plate-glass windows were accompanied by the bar’s soundtrack of folk pop. On the TV, commuters looked through their windshields as giant rocks tore streaks against the blue sky, while in the background singer-songwriters like Panos Giannakakis and Beirut played their heartful hearts out.

I asked a female bartender, who had spiky hair and a muscularity bordering on belligerence, for help. She gave me the gist by using some unintentionally hilarious charades to plug our overlapping language gaps.

I remained puzzled, though, by the images shot from the cars. How could so many Russians happen to have been driving with their video cameras turned on at the precise moment an asteroid flashed past?

 > As you can see, we don’t get many tourists here. I want to get the word out…. The Americans will buy anything.

Sigh. That’s the thing with authentic experiences, I guess. People like Maria need to make a living, too, and that often requires competing with Hard Rock and every other mass-market business that can more easily afford high urban rents.


What is authenticity, exactly? The British writer Kingsley Amis once wrote:

> Unquestioning devotion to authenticity is, in any department of life, a mark of the naive—or worse.

Amis was referring to connoisseurship of the obscure or pricey, I think. If so, point taken.

But by authenticity in travel, I mean something more democratically-minded, something that anyone could feel, no matter how inexperienced or poor he or she might be. I mean something that describes an unexpected, irreproducible moment that takes you outside of your habits and default egocentric views and into another people’s way of life.

This isn’t easy. It’s quite difficult, in this century, to visit Athens and look at it with the same freshness of eye as someone, say, visiting during a “grand tour” in the 1700s. Today’s traveler visiting the Acropolis for the first time reflexively compares it against the picture postcards in his or her mind’s eye. “Does it measure up to what it’s supposed to look like?” is what we ask ourselves, instead of “What does it look like?”

So much of modern life has been “media-tized.” Tourism too often involves seeing “in person” places that you’ve already seen first “virtually” on the TV or Internet. In my own case, I had seen a thousand images of Athens before I ever set foot there.

Compounding the problem is when you choose a type of travel that discourages serendipity, such as when you are on a cruise ship and are insulated from most unpleasant surprises. (Of course, not every cruise ship delivers on its promise to protect its passengers from surprises. The Costa Concordia disaster, bouts of norovirus, and David Foster Wallace’s adventures are all rare exceptions to the rule.)

To break through pre-conceptions and media stereotypes, it helps to talk to locals. I recently found shedloads of helpful examples of how to do this in an un-forced way from “The Turk Who Loved Apples”, in which the well traveled journalist Matt Gross talks about his strategies for getting lost among the locals.

One tip: Before you leave, read a book or magazine article about the place, and then when you get there, ask a local an informed question based on it. (“I’ve read that there’s a renewed interest in the Greek blues of the 1920s now. Is that for real?”)

Another tip is not to complain, which seems obvious, but I think I’ve overheard most of the tourists I’ve met griping, which can come off as condescending, self-centered, or unfriendly.

Gross says:

> I have needed to experience the bad in order to understand the good, and I have needed to accept all experiences on their own terms, without prejudice or expectation, for every corner of the world, every bite of food, every half-drunk Canadian wanderer has had something new and wondrous to show me.

In the effort to catch authenticity and ignore occasional hassles and surprises, you may be lucky enough to see the lively gestures of a very modern Athenian bartender, smell a garlicky bowl of fresh snails, or hear the soft fretwork of a guitarist playing “Fragosyriani.” Whether any of those moments qualifies as purely and truly “authentic” is ultimately beside the point.

Weeks after returning from Athens, I heard an explanation for all of the cameras in the Siberian cars. It turns out that many Russians record what’s happening outside of their vehicles. Sometimes the cameras record accidents; sometimes, police requests for bribes; sometimes, pedestrians attempting to get injured to file insurance claims. Fascinating.
