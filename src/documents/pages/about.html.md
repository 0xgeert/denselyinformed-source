#Let's Make Data Count
Spreadsheets, Social Sites and Nike+. Data is everywhere. But let's be real: data is useless if it's gathering dust.

##### There's a lot to be won
Large busineses that have learned to analyze and derive meaning from data flourish. However, it's a big step to get there. It wouldn't be much of an advantage otherwise. 

#####So how to get started?
Getting inspired by long lists of data is not everyone's cup of tea. But that's okay, as that's exactly what we're about.

Clearskyabove.com brings Data Science to the doorstep of small business owners, data enthousiasts and people that build awesome stuff.

#####So what does that mean?
Whether you want to use our cleaned &amp; enriched<!--(live)--> datafeeds or bring-your-own, we'll provide you with the tools to easily combine data, discover patterns, derive insight, and present the results in a meaningful way.

#####Making data sing
Sometimes you just want the cold hard facts. We get it. You'll be pleased to know that all data and results are always accessible through your account or by hooking up to our flexible API's (?). 

Whether your goal is to be better informed yourself, or to better engage your audience, you'll have access to easy charts and widgets, dashboards, beautiful embeddable maps and other data visualization tools for you to make the most of.

#####Humble beginnings

That's the vision. We think it's incredibly exiting. Of course we're not there yet, we're starting small.
